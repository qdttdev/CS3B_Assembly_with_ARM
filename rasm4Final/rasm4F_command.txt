(1157) Look what we found in the park in the dark.
(1158) We will take him home, we will call him Clark.
(1159) He will live at our house, he will grow and grow.
(1160) Will our mother like this? We don't know.
(1161) 
(1162) And now, Good night.
(1163) It is time to sleep
(1164) So we will sleep with our pet Zeep.
(1165) Today is gone. Today was fun.
(1166) Tomorrow is another one.
(1167) Every day, from here to there.
